## The problem

The [Austin JavaScript Meetup](https://austinjavascript.com/) is hosted at Cloudflare, where there
are pretty strict policies requiring that the doors not be held open. This means we need one of the
organizers to let people in as they arrive and usher them to the space where we hold the Meetup —
which is fine except that once the talk starts we need to either stop letting people in, or someone
needs to hang out by the door for a bit and miss a chunk of the talk.
