I've recently found myself thinking about water bottles more than I think a
normal person probably does, so I thought I'd compile all of the different stuff
I've noticed when looking around.

## So many features

- What material is it made from?

  - Is it durable?
  - Is it recyclable?
  - How much does it weigh when empty?
  - Is it collapsible to save space when empty?
  - Is it translucent so you can you see the amount of liquid inside?

- How much water does it hold?
- Does it have measurement markings?
- How wide is the base?

  - Will it fit in your car's drink holder? What about a backpack pocket?

- Is it Insulated?
- Can it hold hot liquid?
- Can it hold things other than water?
- Does it have a wide mouth? Or a detachable mouthpiece?
  - Does it require a brush when handwashing?
  - Do ice cubes fit easily in the opening?
- Is it dishwasher safe?
- Is it leakproof?

- Can it be opened with one hand?
- Does it have a built-in straw?

- Does it have a loop or something that can be used to carry and as an attachment point?
  - Does it require a separate carabiner/clip, or is the clip built into the bottle?
- Does the bottle have an ecosystem of accessories that you can add? (for example, Nalgene)

- Can it clean water via filter or UV light?
- Does it have a loose leaf tea basket/filter?

- How much does it cost? (useful to think about for your willingness to replace it should it be lost/damaged)

The thing that keeps me coming back to this is just _how many_ different little features there are, and how easy they are to overlook. Now, when I see something new on a water bottle, I _have to_ add it to the list!

## Where I've landed (for now)

For now, I'm using the [Owala 24oz FreeSip](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085DTZQNZ), and am pretty happy with these features:

- Leakproof
- Has an attachment point/carry handle
- Can be opened with one hand
- Has a straw
- Also has an option to tip and drink
- Insulated
- Kinda easy to clean
- Fits in my car cup holder and backpack sleeve pocket
