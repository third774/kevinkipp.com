import Link from "../../components/Link.astro";

For a little while now, I've been wanting to set up a page and RSS feed where I
can share links, kinda similar to [Jeremy Keith's links page](https://adactio.com/links).
Until now, I've mostly been using Astro's [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)
to manage my [/blog](/blog) and [/wish](/wish) pages, which has worked out nicely.

I didn't want to use content collections just for sharing a link, though. That
felt like too much friction. I wanted to be able to make a Raycast extension
for myself to quickly share a link, maybe with an optional remark about it.

In order to do this, I was going to need an API with a database. Since I work
at Cloudflare I generally try to use it as much as possible, so I knew I wanted
to use [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/), and have been hearing good
things about [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/), so I figured I'd give that a
go. I plan on writing up a guide on how I set everything up, but for now...

Check out the new page over at <sparkly-text style="--sparkly-text-color: oklch(89.12% 0.141 103.76); --sparkly-text-size: 2.5em"><Link href="/shared">/shared</Link></sparkly-text>
