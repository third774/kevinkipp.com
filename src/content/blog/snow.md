More visual web component fun — this `<snow-fall>` [web component from Zach Leatherman](https://www.zachleat.com/web/snow-fall/) (originally from [alphardex](https://codepen.io/alphardex/pen/dyPorwJ)) is so festive and easy. I _had_ to add it for a few months.

```html
<snow-fall></snow-fall>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@zachleat/snow-fall@1.0.1/snow-fall.js"></script>
```

<snow-fall></snow-fall>
