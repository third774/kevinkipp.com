Saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/passle_/status/1743608723291988373) from [@passle\_](https://twitter.com/passle_)
and thought this was pretty dang clever. He goes on to [explain](https://twitter.com/passle_/status/1743609221386490244) the relatively simple technique:

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<template shadowrootmode="open">
			<h1>Hello world</h1>
			<slot name="id-1">
				Loading...
			</slot>
			<footer>Copyright</footer>
		</template>
		<div slot="id-1">
			Content loaded!
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

So, when the HTML document above is streaming into the browser, the children of `<slot name="id-1">` will be displayed until the `<div slot="id-1">` is streamed in! How cool is that?
