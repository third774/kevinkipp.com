I'm obsessed with QR codes. I don't know why I'm like this. I just love the fact that they can
be printed on paper to encode information in a way that doesn't require any power and can be
read by any phone.

I was talking to a co-worker today about them, and had the idea of using a `tel:` link in a QR
code for someone to be able to call you, and it turns out that works!

```js
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shoelace-style/shoelace@2.20.1/cdn/shoelace.js"
></script>
<sl-qr-code
  value="tel:+17192662837"
  label="Scan to call Callin' Oates, your emergency Hall & Oates helpline"
></sl-qr-code>
```

<script
	type="module"
	src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shoelace-style/shoelace@2.20.1/cdn/shoelace.js"
></script>

<a style="display: block" href="tel:+17192662837">
	<sl-qr-code
		value="tel:+17192662837"
		label="Scan this code to listen to Emergency Hall & Oates"
	></sl-qr-code>
</a>

This also got me wondering if it could similarly be done for texting instead of calling, and it
CAN! Just swap `tel:` for `sms:`!
