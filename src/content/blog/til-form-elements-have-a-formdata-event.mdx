Whoa, this is neat. Check out the [`FormDataEvent` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormDataEvent)!

You don't need to construct an instance of `FormData` if instead of listening for `submit` events you listen for `formdata` events!

```js
// modified from MDN docs for brevity
formElem.addEventListener("formdata", (e) => {
	const formData = e.formData;
	console.log("formdata fired", formData);
});
```

It even has [great browser support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_formdataevent)!
