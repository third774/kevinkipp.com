Like most front-end developers, I've done the ol' _build a blog_ thing that ends with me spending
way more time working on _building_ the blog, only to post like once or twice before letting it
sit idle for years.

This time around, I decided it would be different. Part of that was picking tech that is simple,
like [Astro](https://astro.build). But that alone wasn't all I needed. What _really_ did it for me
was realizing that I was making it too hard for myself.

I made a few changes, and surprise — I feel like posting way more often!

1. By default, the Astro blog example requires a hero image and description for each post. Removing these
   was way more liberating than I thought it would be!
2. I realized don't need to make each post such a big deal. Doesn't need to be a long, super well
   thought out essay. Saw something cool? Post something super short about it! I appreciate other
   people doing this. I should do it too.
3. Scripting the creation of a new blog post — this is the icing on the cake. At first I had created
   a script in my blog to create a new post file that would ask for the post title and create the
   file for me. But then I came across [Script Kit](https://www.scriptkit.com/) and thought I could
   make a script to do this without even having my blog open in VS Code yet.

Here's the script:

```ts
// Name: New Astro Blog Post

import "@johnlindquist/kit";

const title = await arg("What's the title of the post?");
const description = await arg("What's the description of the post?");
const slug = title.toLowerCase().split(" ").join("-");
const blogCollectionPath = await env("ASTRO_BLOG_COLLECTION_PATH");
const content = `---
{
  "title": "${title}",${
		description ? `\n  "description": "${description}",` : ""
	}
  "published": "${new Date().toISOString()}"
}
---

`;
const filePath = `${blogCollectionPath}/${slug}.md`;
const editedContent = await editor(content);
await writeFile(filePath, editedContent);
await exec(`/opt/homebrew/bin/code ${filePath}`);
```

This is _delightful_. Starting a blog post is a breeze.
