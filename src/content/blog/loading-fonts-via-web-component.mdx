I made a silly little `<google-font>` web component to load fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com), I think it's kinda fun.

<p
	class="codepen"
	data-height="331.171875"
	data-default-tab="html,result"
	data-slug-hash="WNPmpjK"
	data-user="third774"
	style="height: 331.171875px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"

## Use it in markdown?

In Jake Lazaroff's article [Web Components Will Outlive Your JavaScript Framework](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/web-components-will-outlive-your-javascript-framework/) he says:

> But Markdown has a secret weapon: you can write HTML inside of it! That means any fancy interactive diagrams I wanted to add would be just as portable as my the rest of my Markdown as long as I could express them as plain HTML tags.

This got me thinking — dang, I could use this in my markdown files to <google-font display="swap" family="Frijole">spice things up a bit!</google-font>

<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@third774/google-font"></script>
