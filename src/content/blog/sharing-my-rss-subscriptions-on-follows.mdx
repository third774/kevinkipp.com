I recently gave a talk at the [Austin JavaScript Meetup](https://austinjavascript.com/posts/meetups/2024/02/20/) and
a good chunk of the talk was about the [Feedbin Extension for Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/third774/feedbin) I built
using [Feedbin's API](https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin-api). After someone asked about the feeds I subscribe to, I
thought I could easily build a page for it pulling the data from the API. So here it is — my [/follows](/follows) page!
