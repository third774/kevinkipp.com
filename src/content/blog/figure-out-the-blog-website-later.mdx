I saw something yesterday on Twitter that I just truly loved. [Brooks Lybrand](https://x.com/BrooksLybrand) (currently dev-rel at Remix) wrote
that they're starting a blog, and did _the coolest_ thing — they just... [started](https://github.com/brookslybrand/brookslybrand.com/blob/main/seeds/start.md) publishing `.md` files to Github.

I'd have to guess they're not the first person to take this approach, but I love the pragmatism of this. Nearly
every developer "starts a blog". Sometimes it doesn't end up being a lasting endeavor, which is fine. But like,
if you _think_ you want to start a blog, just start writing. If you keep it up long enough you'll want to invest
the time to build a website for it, and then when you launch it won't feel like an empty shell of a website. If
you don't keep writing, at least you didn't spend a bunch of time building it (not to discount the learning that
takes place in the process).

I didn't do this, but I wish I had. It'll be my advice going forward!
