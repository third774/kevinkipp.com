When Steph Ango published the [Flexoki color scheme](https://stephango.com/flexoki)
I immediately loved it, and wanted to try using it in VS Code.

I've also been a big fan of Sarah Drasner's [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) theme. I found her choices for various tokens that should share colors to be very sensible, and wanted to keep those groupings.

So I've forked Night Owl and created [Paper Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=third774.paper-owl), meticulously using lots of find/replace to fill in colors from Flexoki.

I've been using it for a little while now, and am pretty pleased with it! Give it a try, and please let me know if you find any issues! üôèüèª
