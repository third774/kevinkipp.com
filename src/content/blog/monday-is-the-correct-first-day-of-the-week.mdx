## Optimizing for the future

When you look at your calendar, what % of the time are you looking forward at events yet to come, and what % of the time are you looking back at events in the past? It's pretty rare that I'm interested in past calendar events.

So I'm switching. Actually, I switched a few months ago.

I mentioned this to [Taylor Smith](https://tsmith.com/blog/), to which he replied:

Which is fair. ðŸ˜…

I'm _still_ getting used to it. It's just wild that we've all settled for only seeing half of the upcoming weekend on our calendar. **NO MORE!**
